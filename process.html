            <p>Working on something you love is a joy. We all love bubble tea, it is everywhere and it is deeply unsustainable. Once we were sure that there's a great single-use plastics problem in the bubble tea industry, we all felt that this is the perfect topic to work on for our 521 class. </p>

          <p><b>Approach & Results:</b> As we were a team of three, we simply split the topics we had to research into three parts: The justification of our identified problem, the stakeholders/system components, and research questions. We researched on the internet, summed up and presented our results using powerpoint.</p>    
          <p><b>Reflection:</b> We quickly found data that justified our problem and got useful feedback from our instructor. She pointed out that it is not clear if the problem is a recylcing problem or a packaging design problem. In general, the presentation was very helpful and while working on the other assignments, I often used it as a knowledge collection. We now knew what we do not know and were able to come up with a first design question. In future projects I will definitely stress the importance of solid secondary research as a fundamental part to navigating a design cycle.</p>

          <p><b>Approach & Results:</b> Our primary research consisted of two seperate parts. On one hand, all three team members did a field study and observed at three boba shop at different locations in Seattle and Bellevue where we hoped to meet the different user groups found in our secondary research. On the other hand, we conducted a survey to later be able ot prioritize our requirements with quantitative data. A key finding of our secondary research was the fact that there were two user groups which differ vastly in their behavior regarding waste disposal that we had not thought of before. In-store and take-out consumers. </p>

          <p>We studied how transparent and milky acrylics bends under the influence of heat and break light in mint, bent, or etched states. We used a heat gun to heat the acrylic, laser cutters for etching, and LED strips as the light source. Bending acrylic with heat is possible and easy on thin and slender pieces of acrylic. Transparent acrylic breaks the light, whereas milky acrylic glows golden but does not break the light. When confining the light source to spread in a certain area (such as in a cardboard box) and obstructing it with transparent acrylic pieces, the light can break nicely. The tests were promising, but we want to test more materials.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Material Study  #2 - Resin and Hot Glue</h2>
          <p>We studied how resin and hot glue shapes break light. The shapes were created using a silicone mold. LED strips were used as the light source. The resin does not break the light but emits a steady warm glow. The same applies to hot glue since neither of the shapes turned out to be transparent after hardening. We will not use resin or hot glue shapes in our prototypes because their properties in breaking light are similar to the ones found in milky acrylic.</p>

          <p>We took what we've learned from the milky acrylic study and attempted to create a first prototype to recreate the natural quality of "Komorebi". The prototype was constituted of an "eyeball"-lamp with one rotational axis that would allow it to move from one side to the other over a day.  Milky acrylic leaves were used to obstruct the light. We hoped the leaves would create a golden glow.</p>    
          <p><b>Result:</b> We could not create the desired effect because our light source was too close to the obstructing leaves. Also, in reality, the light rays of the sun travel parallelly and hit objects from a certain direction. In our prototype, this was not the case. </p>
          <p><b>Learning:</b> Recreating the sun requires creativity.</p>

          <p>We took what we've learned from the transparent acrylic study and created a second prototype using water's light reflection properties. We used an adjustable light beam spotlight LED bulb. It allowed us to choose the perfect focus of light.</p>    
            <p><b>Result:</b> We were able to create a wonderful organic light play in a room if we position the light source at a certain angle and distance and kept the water in motion. However, the positioning of the light source turned out to be a real challenge, since even with the most focused light setting, the light would still dissipate too much before hitting the small water bath.  </p>
            <p><b>Learning:</b> We need to confine the space the light can travel in, such that as much as possible hits the water bath. This goes in line with our findings from material study #1.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Prototype #3 - Cardboard Box</h2>
          <p>Combining everything we have learned so far, we decided to box our light source, and instead of directly projecting organic shapes on the walls of a room, we now aimed to create projections on the top side of the box using paper as a screen, aiming that in a dark room, the projections would also be visible on the room's surfaces. The insides of a cardboard box were lined with a Mylar sheet. We planned to install the water basin on the bottom surface of the box to create projects on a paper sheet obstructing the top side of the box. </p>    
            <p><b>Result:</b> We quickly noticed that the imperfections of the Mylar sheet's surface on the box's walls, combined with lightly moving our light source, already created beautiful, organic projections on the paper surface, without even installing the basin.  </p>
            <p><b>Learning:</b> We decided to move away from using water to create organic light projections and focus solely on the reflective properties of the Mylar sheet. </p>

          <p>Our final prototype is a rectangular, wooden, and hollow box that can be used as a coffee table. The top surface of the box is comprised of two layers of glass with one layer of trace paper in-between. All walls of the box are coated with Mylar sheets. The light source is installed at a fixed angle in the center of the box and an electric motor in the inside of the box powers two rotational surfaces that are coated in Mylar sheet. The surfaces rotated at around 0.9 rounds per minute. Organic and slowly shifting light projections are created on the paper surface and radiate even further on the surroundings. The materials glass and wood give the product a finished feel. </p>
