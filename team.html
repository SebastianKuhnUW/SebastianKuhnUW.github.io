      <h2 class="mt0">Project Description</h2>
        <p>Bubble Tea has a global market size of $2.5bn, and this is projected to double by 2028. In the Seattle area alone, there are over 60 Bubble Tea stores, serving between 150 and 500 servings daily. This means between 10,000 and 34,000 plastic cups are being used daily for Bubble Tea in the Seattle Area.</p>    
        <p>Due to unique packaging challenges specific to the Bubble Tea experience, such as large straws to suck up the pearls, or a high emphasis on packaging aesthetics, simple solutions to reduce the usage of single-use plastics that work for coffee stores or other food and beverage competitors are not easily transferable to Bubble Tea. This has resulted in inadequate solutions to the high consumption of single-use plastics in the Bubble Tea industry, which the Boba Busters addressed in this project.</p>

            <p>Our sustainable boba experience would have never turned out that well without the great project team behind it. A community of fate thrown together based on their differing backgrounds. A big warm thank you to Rhea (Rui) Huang and Alex Simpson for being awesome teammates. 
            </p>
              <p>Rhea, a trained landscape designer did an awesome job on complementing the group's perspectives and stopped Alex and me when we were chatting away, getting lost in some idea. With her detail-oriented approach, she added a great look to all of our deliverables and oftentime contributed the one crucial missing piece of information to our discussions.</p>
            <p>Alex, a mathematician at heart, always made sure we keep our logic reasonable and added many good ideas in our brainstorming sessions. The fact that he is a native English speaker always helped in writing down what Rhea and I could not phrase. I can proudly say that we did not only work well together, 521 also made us great friends.</p>

            <h2>Sebastian Kuhn</h2>
            <p> I majored in Economics and have collected a lot of work experience in the field of Data Science over the past years. Additionally, I have collected a considerable amount of leadership experience in the Swiss Army and have often acted as a project manager ever since. I think I usually try to approach all my projects in a structured manner and I did the same with our 521 project. As I did not want any hierarchies to develop I tried not to start "managing" the group but simply imposing a little bit of structure. I am a big fan of meetings that start on time and that have a cap so that all of the meeting time is used productively. Additionally, I tried to make sure that we assign responsibilities we could keep each other accountable for. Beyond that, I often gave our presentations and documents the final touch and made sure that all work is split equally.</p>          </div>
