          <p>First of all, this course has been a really fun ride. After this class, I feel much more comfortable working with ambiguity because I know that ambiguity does always exist, but it can be handled with the right process at hand. There two largest take-aways from this class for me are the following:</p>
          <p><b>Insight #1 - </b> I am amazed at how much we created in these 10 weeks we were working together. I attribute this to operating under a clear project structure and time constraints. In future creative work, I would want to keep this style of work going and establish frequent deliverables to hold project members accountable and mentally involved.</p>    
          <p><b>Insight #2 - </b> We never lost focus of the problem we were trying to solve and the path was always clear. I think this is because we were following the design question as our true north. For future creative work, I will always want to establish a mutually understood and adaptable design question every project member knows.</p>
          <p><b>Insight #3 - </b> Even though both of my teammates did not have substantial work experience, we still managed to establish work routines that felt professional. The dynamics were often harmonic and still, everyone seemed to contribute equally to each deliverable. We never put a lot of work into establishing these routines and it nearly felt like it was too good to be true. I wonder if I feel this way because I am a rather dominant person when it comes to group work and just did not notice me crowding out the other's opinions. However, I feel everyone enjoyed the work progress based on their feedbacks. Writing this reflection makes me feel like it would be worth reflecting on our team dynamics as a team more strongly. At this point, I do not know if my team shared all the "ugly" with me. In the end, maybe our team was just a very good match-up.</p>
          <p><b>Insight #4 - </b> We produced a prototype and I feel like it fits all the requirements we were trying to implement. Still, there are many factors we have not regarded, and thinking about this feels somewhat intimidating. How can we reduce the ambiguity and our lack of knowledge as much such that we can be comfortable launching our solution as a real product? How much uncertainty is normal? This is a question this Design Thinking class did not answer me. We always worked in this "laboratory" environment and often talked about what we would and would not do in the "real world". </p>          <p><b>Insight #5 - </b> We never lost focus of the problem we were trying to solve and the path was always clear. I think this is because we were following the design question as our true north. For future creative work, I will always want to establish a mutually understood and adaptable design question every project member knows.</p>
          <p><b>Insight #5 - </b> I never felt emotionally attached to our idea. I think this is because I never really liked our final prototype. I liked that it fit our requirements, but I never felt this excitement I felt when I produced a prototype in fabrication or when I finished a piece of code in Programming.  Our boba experience always felt very intangible. This might be a good thing because it is the answer to a wicked problem. A simple machine or software will not solve it. I think what this tells me is that I am a very visual person who enjoys seeing the fruits of his work. Our final prototype in its low fidelity did not give me this feeling of finishing something, even though we learned a lot. I think I am now better aware of that and while the emotional distance helps in not getting too enamored with one certain idea, I still consciously want to appreciate our final prototype and all the knowledge we've gained more.  </p>
          <p>Our 521 class was a demanding and fun experience for me and while I would have loved to invest more of my time into diving deeper into the readings and theories around design thinking, I still think it equipped me with the essential tools I need to succeed on a design team and a great base of knowledge that I can always revert to when I need it.</p>
